## Controls
### Camera Controls
Hold right click and drag mouse to turn camera (pitch and yaw motion). The motion of the camera is FPS-like. Keyboard arrows can be used for camera movement as well.

Keys N and M turn the camera in a roll motion.

While holding right click, WASD can be used to move the camera forwards, backwards and sideways, relative to the angle of the camera. Q and E keys move the camera up and down relative to the world coordinates.

Holding SHIFT while moving triples movement speed.
